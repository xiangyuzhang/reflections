Head means the current commit

If we checkout into a history, we can also make some changes and commmit as well.

But as soon as we checkout to other branch, the commit will disappeare. So the thing we can choose to retain a commit is to create a branch to it.

To do this, we need cmmd:

git checkout -b branchname
