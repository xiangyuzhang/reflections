working directory: is just a real folder that can be seen and mantipulated

stage: after init in working directory, every changed in working directory should be “git add” before commit. And ‘git commit” will definitely upload all the thing in stage all at once
in addition, stage also copy the most recent commit

repository: all the history commited changed will be shored here
